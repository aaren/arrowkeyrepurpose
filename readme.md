Arrow Key Repurpose
===================

A small simple plugin for repurposing the arrow keys in Vim. Taken from some
blog somewhere, which was in turn taken from an older version of
[this page](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Quickly_adding_and_deleting_empty_lines)
on the vim wiki, then modified by myself for my own purposes.

It is important to note that I still keep my hands on the home row, even while
using these mappings, by use of a Windows program called
[touchcursor](http://touchcursor.sourceforge.net/).
